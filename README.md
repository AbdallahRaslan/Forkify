<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](screenshot.jpg)

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Parcel to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease
servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.

### Built With

This app is built with pure vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and SCSS. It uses parcel as module bundler and NPM as package manager.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

   increase or decrease the amount of servings they need.

3. Bookmarked recipes are stored in local storage so no database was
   required for this application.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

There's a list of proposed features (and known issues).

### Proposed features

1. Number of pages between the pagination buttons.

2. Ability to sort search results by duration or number of ingredients.

3. Ingredient validation in view, before submitting the form.

4. Improving recipe ingredient input: separate in multiple fields and allow more
   than 6 ingredients.

5. Shopping list feature: button on recipe to add ingredients to a list.

6. Weekly meal planning feature: assign recipes to the next 7 days and show
   on a weekly calendar.
